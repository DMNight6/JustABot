# JustABot
 Just a bot that I [live stream](https://twitch.tv/dmnight6) at :D
 [This is a rewrite from python to typescript]

## Setup
1. Install the required dependecies

    You will need â€¢
    
    [Node 16+ with NPM selected](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    

    After installing, do: `<npm install>` (Make sure you are in the correct bot directory)

1. Setting up the bot
```env
    TOKEN = "EXAMPLE_BOT_TOKEN"
```
Replace `<EXAMPLE_BOT_TOKEN>` with your bot token. No need to create your own .env as I already provivded the file for you.

Note: You need to rename the file from `<example.env -> .env>`

1. Start the bot
By doing `<npm run start>`, the bot will boot up, logging with bot name + tag with a few string.

### TODO

- [x] Make everything slash command only.
- [] Add 24/7 command.
